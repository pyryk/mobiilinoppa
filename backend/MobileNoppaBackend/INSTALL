
Installation instructions for the backend
-----------------------------------------

You need to have the following installed:
- Oracle Java JDK 6 or newer
- Eclipse

Create a new Eclipse workspace and import the following projects into it:
- /backend/Libraries
- /backend/MobileNoppaBackend

You can start the backend by running the mobilenoppa.MobileNoppaBackend class as a Java Application
from the project MobileNoppaBackend. The backend will then bind itself to localhost:8080 and serve
JSON content from there, for instance try http://localhost:8080/course/t-111.5360/all in your
web browser.

You can also build the backend for running outside Eclipse workspace. Run the "jar" target from
the Ant build script MobileNoppaBackend/build.xml to generate the folder
MobileNoppaBackend/build/MobileNoppaBackend. You can copy this folder to wherever you like, and
inside the folder, you can start the backend with:

java -jar MobileNoppaBackend.jar
